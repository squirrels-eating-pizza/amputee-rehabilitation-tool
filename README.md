A Tool to Improve Therapy Treatment of Amputees

This tool is my senior project for California State University, Sacramento.
i helped design and program the tool in a team of eight students.
during the project i learned a lot about the agile process, dealing with obtaining clients requirments,
and about using Flying Donut to track the completion of the requirments.
